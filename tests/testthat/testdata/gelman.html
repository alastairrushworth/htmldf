<blockquote><p>I like <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/frisk9.pdf">this particular study</a> that you did [with Jeff Fagan and Alex Kiss] on racial profiling. </p>
<p>However, I believe that you misrepresented one of the sources on the paper. You state, &#8220;For example, two surveys with nationwide probability samples, completed in 1999 and in 2002, showed that African-Americans were far more likely than others to report being stopped on the highways by police (Langan, Greenfeld, Smith, Durose, and Levin 2001; Durose, Schmitt, and Langan 2005).&#8221; Yet, in  the paper by Durose, Schmitt, and Langan 2005, it shows that the difference in number of African Americans stopped by police relative to whites was statistically insignificant. Can you explain the reason for this discrepancy?</p></blockquote>
<p>I took a quick look at the paper and the references and responded that it seems that it would&#8217;ve been more accurate for us to have said &#8220;more likely&#8221; or &#8220;a bit more likely&#8221; rather than &#8220;far more likely.&#8221;  But the real expert on this is Jeff Fagan, who replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>I [Jeff] have looked again at <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/cpp02.pdf">the 2005 publication</a>.  Table 7 reports that Blacks are stopped more often (9.1%) compared to Whites (8.7%) as a share of drivers in the sample/population.  The authors don&#8217;t report a significance level for the comparison, they use the term &#8220;likelihood.&#8221; If this is a statistical claim, it would be helpful to know that test they used and if there were controls for such important parameters as time of day, location (urban/rural), and other demographic markers.  They claim that the dataset is a representative sample of the US population and its drivers, so it&#8217;s not clear what they mean by &#8220;significance.&#8221; What they report seems to be unadjusted percentages, which is important if the driving patterns vary by race of driver. For example, it would be helpful to break down Table 7 by race and size of jurisdiction (Appendix Table, p. 29), where the populations are less likely to be random and more likely to be clustered by race.  This matters because there is different availability of drivers to the police for stops.  We also don&#8217;t know the base rates of the reasons for the stops, so selective enforcement may underlie the observed patterns.  For example, table 8 shows that the reasons for stops vary by race: Blacks are more likely to be stopped for pretextual reasons (e.g., alleged vehicle defect, such as broken taillight; record check) and less for more concrete reasons such as speeding.  Pretextual reasons of this sort are quite common in the US literature on highway stops and other traffic stops, and have been valorized in constitutional caselaw (U..S. v Whren).  </p>
<p>There are other disparities by race that are notable and (most likely) significant:</p>
<p>&#8211; Fewer blacks report being stopped by police for a legitimate reason (73%) than Whites (86%) or Hispanics (82%)</p>
<p>&#8211; Relative to their share of drivers, Whites were ticketed more often, suggesting that the reasons for stops of Blacks and Hispanics were pretextual and not substantive.  The same differential was reported for arrests of drivers pursuant to stops.</p>
<p>&#8211; Black drivers (78%) were less likely than Whites (90%) to report that police acted &#8220;properly during the stop.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211; Black (10.2%) and Hispanic (11.4%) motorists stopped by police were more likely than whites (3.5%) to be physically searched or to have their vehicle searched. The search disparity was true for searches of drivers, for physical searches, and for searches of the vehicle.</p>
<p>&#8211; Searches without consent were far more likely for Black (58.6% of drivers compared to Whites (39.1%) or Hispanic drivers (46.2%) (Table 11).</p>
<p>&#8211; Blacks (3.5%) and Hispanics (2.5%) were far more likely than Whites (1.1%) to be subject to force or threats of force (Table 16).  Black and Hispanic drivers were also more likely to report that police used &#8220;excessive force&#8221; than Whites (Table 20).</p>
<p>In sum, then, perhaps we might have qualified our initial statement based on the absence of details in the 2005 report about the specifics of their analysis and claim.  But the totality of the circumstances in these stops shows a pattern of disparate treatment of Black and Hispanic drivers that provides more context to explain the meaning of an otherwise modest difference in the simple rates of police contact.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s good to see people reading our papers in enough detail to check the references!</p>

<blockquote><p>An Ivy League law professor writes a deepthoughts think piece explaining a seemingly irrational behavior that doesn&#8217;t actually exist.</p>
<p>(see <a href="https://twitter.com/ATabarrok/status/1245799290586497024">here</a> and  <a href="https://twitter.com/annastansbury/status/1245827728009359362">here</a>)
</p></blockquote>
<p>My favorite <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-02/coronavirus-why-epidemiologists-and-economists-keep-arguing">bit</a> is this, from the Ivy League law professor in question:</p>
<blockquote><p>What’s more, macroeconomists have typically spent their careers preparing to understand and respond to crises in the economy. They are acutely attuned to the grave dangers associated with an economy grinding to a halt.</p></blockquote>
<p>What the hell does that mean?  &#8220;Acutely attuned to the grave dangers&#8221;?  One thing we can say for sure, I guess, is that this guy got a good score on his verbal SAT.  Also &#8220;was a clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justice David Souter.&#8221;  So he&#8217;s got good connections.</p>

<p>Antony Unwin sends along the above graph in response to <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/07/alexey-guzey-plays-stat-detective-how-many-observations-are-in-each-bar-of-this-graph/">this recent post</a>.</p>
<p>The data are kinda crap, but I agree with Antony that this plot is a good way of showing the number of cases corresponding to each <del datetime="2020-10-09T15:22:10+00:00">histogram</del> bar.</p>

<blockquote><p>Nobel prize and other science prices are problematic and this is not endorsement of such prices, but this might be useful for someone who needs to tell (hype) about the impact of Stan (or just as another funny fact about Stan).</p>
<p>Previously Stan was used in the the LIGO gravitational wave research awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2017.</p>
<p>In 2020 half of the the Nobel Prize in Physics <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2020/summary/">was given</a> jointly to Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez “for the discovery of a supermassive compact object at the centre of our galaxy.”  There is at least <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6454/664.full">one paper</a>, “Relativistic redshift of the star S0-2 orbiting the Galactic Center supermassive black hole,” co-authored by Andrea Ghez, using Stan to validate their Bayesian modeling results (and using <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/loo_stan.pdf">elpd</a> for model comparison, but it’s not mentioned whether loo or ArviZ was used). (Since this paper was published in 2019, use of Stan didn’t probably have causal effect for the prize, or maybe the prize committee was convinced only after this paper as it used Stan?)</p></blockquote>

					<div class="at-above-post-homepage addthis_tool" data-url="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/08/misrepresenting-data-from-a-published-source-it-happens-all-the-time/"></div><p>Following up on <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/07/alexey-guzey-plays-stat-detective-how-many-observations-are-in-each-bar-of-this-graph/">yesterday&#8217;s post</a> on an example of misrepresentation of data from a graph, I wanted to share a much more extreme example that I <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/dontbelieve3.pdf">wrote about</a> awhile ago, about some data misrepresentation in an old statistics textbook:</p>
<blockquote><p>About fifteen years ago, when preparing to teach an introductory statistics class, I recalled an enthusiastic review I had read (Sills 1986) of the sixth edition of Hans Zeisel’s (1985) book, Say It With Figures. I bought the book and, flipping through it to find examples for use in class, came across the two sketches reproduced in figure 2.</p>
<p><img src="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-03-at-10.31.21-AM.png" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>The curves represent data from hospital admissions of premenopausal women who had been involved in traffic accidents, with the left hump representing accidents that had occurred just before the menstrual period and the right hump showing accidents occurring just after the period.</p>
<p>This seemed like a great example for class. I figured that a graph of the actual data would be even better than a sketch, so I went to the library and found the cited research by Katharina Dalton (1960). The graphs are reproduced in figure 3, and they look nothing like Zeisel’s sketches in figure 2!</p>
<p><img src="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Screen-Shot-2020-04-03-at-11.01.47-AM.png" alt="" width="650" /></p>
<p>For one thing, the sketched densities show almost all the probability mass just before and after menstruation, but the data show only about half the accidents occurring in these periods. Perhaps more seriously, the sketch shows two modes with a gap in the middle, whereas the data show no evidence for such a gap. Similarly, the two bell-shaped pictures in the right sketch of figure 2 do not match the actual data as shown in the histograms on the right side of figure 3.</p>
<p>Dalton’s findings were conveniently summarized by an article in Time magazine on November 28, 1960: “In four London general hospitals Dr Dalton questioned 84 female accident victims (age range 15–55), all of whom had normal, 28-day menstrual cycles. Her findings: 52% of the accidents occurred to women who were within four days, either way, of the beginning of menstruation. On a purely random basis, the rate would have been only 28.5% for the same eight days. Childless women, noted Dr Dalton, appear to be abnormally accident-prone just before menstruation, while women who have borne children are vulnerable over the whole premenstrual and menstrual period.” What is relevant to our discussion here is that these findings were not accurately described in Zeisel’s book. On an unrelated but amusing (from a current perspective) note, the Time article quoted Dalton as saying that these findings “cause one to consider the wisdom of administering tranquilizers for premenstrual tension.”</p>
<p>I suspect that Zeisel heard about the research (perhaps even by reading Time magazine), recognized that it would be a good teaching example, and went to the library to read Dalton’s original article. He then could have too hastily summarized the data in a sketch, inadvertently knocking out most of the accidents that did not occur just before or after menstruation and mistakenly inserting a gap in his histogram between the two modes. Or perhaps he was looking for an example of a mixture model and didn’t look too closely at the data. In any case, this is a benefit to our students, who get a lesson in how easy it is to misread a research report. Had Zeisel’s book not been so appealing and well written, we would not have been drawn to the example in the first place.</p>
<p>For teachers, the most important lesson is that going to the source of the data turned up a better example to use in class. For students, the lesson is to be sceptical when seeing second-hand reports of data, even when coming from a credible-seeming source.</p></blockquote>
<p>The above example of one of three in my article, which concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Teaching activities already exist in which students apply critical reading skills to news reports and scientific articles with statistical content; here, the recommendation is to have an inquiring eye when reading books that we teach from as well. Much can be learned by redoing analyses and going to the primary and secondary sources to look at data more carefully, and this can help us improve our teaching, even from our favourite books.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article was published in a British journal, hence the classy spelling in that last sentence.</p>
<p>Again, I have no reason to believe that the textbook author misrepresented the data on purpose.  I&#8217;m guessing it was just sloppiness:  he read the original source, abstracted the key message as he saw it, then redrew it using those bell-shaped curves, never thinking that it would have been easy enough to just copy the actual data and make the point directly from there.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong>  Kaiser made <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fung_gelman_dalton_parous_accidents.png">these plots to present the above information more appealingly while remaining faithful to the reported data:</p>

<p>How many data points are in each bar of the top graph above? (<a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/12/27/why-we-sleep-data-manipulation-a-smoking-gun/">See here</a> for background.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s from <a href="http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c779/f792f5b07593b283d3e9efa80000d1e46378.pdf">this article</a>: Milewski MD, Skaggs DL, Bishop GA, Pace JL, Ibrahim DA, Wren TA, Barzdukas A. Chronic lack of sleep is associated with increased sports injuries in adolescent athletes. Journal of Pediatric Orthopaedics. 2014 Mar 1;34(2):129-33.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the information we have to work with:</p>
<blockquote><p>This study was conducted at a combined high school/middle school in a large metropolitan area. . . . Eligible participants included any male or female student at the school who was entering grades 7 to 12 who had participated and planned to continue to participate in at least one sport during the previous and upcoming year. . . . Informed consent for participation in our study was obtained from 160 student athletes and their parents. All consenting students were sent a copy of the survey by school-registered email. Of the 160, 112 student athletes (54 male and 58 female athletes) completed the survey . . . Of the 112 athletes studied, 64 athletes (57%) sustained a total of 205 injuries; 48 athletes (43%) were not injured. . . . Sixty-five percent of athletes (56/86) who reported sleeping < 8 hours per night were injured, compared with 31% of athletes (8/26) who reported sleeping ≥ 8 hours per night.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is like one of those logic puzzles they gave us when we were kids!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s label the proportions in the bar graph as y5/n5, y6/n6, y7/n7, y8/n8, y9/n9.</p>
<p>What do we know?  From the text:</p>
<blockquote><p>• n5 + n6 + n7 + n8 + n9 = 112</p>
<p>• n5 + n6 + n7 = 86</p>
<p>• n8 + n9 = 26 (this is redundant information but it&#8217;s good to check that 26 + 86 = 112 so we&#8217;re not missing anybody)</p>
<p>• y5 + y6 + y7 = 56</p>
<p>• y8 + y9 = 8</p></blockquote>
<p>From the graph:</p>
<blockquote><p>• y5/n5 = 60%</p>
<p>• y6/n6 = 75%</p>
<p>• y7/n7 = 62% (Guzey counted the pixels:  310/499 = 0.621)</p>
<p>• y8/n8 = 35%</p>
<p>• y9/n9 = 16.7%</p>
<p>• n5 + n6 </p></blockquote>
<p>Given all this information, Guzey solved the puzzle.  I&#8217;ll paraphrase:</p>
<blockquote><p>• The easiest place to start is with the last two bars, which represent a total of 8 injuries out of 26 kids.  It&#8217;s gotta be 7/20 and 1/6, as there are the only numbers that give anything close to 35% and 16.7%.  For example, 6/14 and 2/12 won&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>• Next you can figure out the first three bars, which represent a total of 56 injuries out of 86 kids.  The only numbers that are consistent with the above information is 3/5, 15/20, and 38/61.  You can play around with other possibilities and they just don&#8217;t work out.</p></blockquote>
<p>So now we can ask, why did Matthew Walker in his book Why We Sleep remove the left bar of that graph (3 injuries out of 5 kids) but keep the right bar (1 injury out of 6) so as to produce the second graph shown above?</p>
<p>The answer is clear.  He cut off the left bar because it was based on N=5.  He kept the right bar because it was based on N=6.  Walker was following the well known <em>remove all bars for which N is less than 6</em> rule.</p>
<p>Ok, just kidding.  I think the real reason he removed the left bar and kept the right bar is that the left bar didn&#8217;t support his story that lack of sleep is bad for you, but the right bar did support his theory.  He didn&#8217;t want to confuse the reader with the complexities of reality.</p>
<p>Not wanting to confuse the reader with the complexities of reality is ok if you know the underlying truth, but it&#8217;s not such a great idea if you don&#8217;t have a direct line to God and if, like everyone else, you have to rely on empirical evidence to make your conclusions.</p>
<p>To step back a moment, how much can you really conclude about sleep and injuries based on a one-time study at one school?  So, from that point of view, you&#8217;d have to say that Walker must have already had strong beliefs about the danger of sleeping less than 8 hours a night, and these data provide confirmation rather than evidence.  They&#8217;re an illustration of his point rather than evidence for his point.  Fair enough; still, if you want to present data, you shouldn&#8217;t cheat.</p>
<p><strong>The larger point</strong></p>
<p>The larger point here is not about cheating or research misconduct; it&#8217;s about research more generally.  It&#8217;s about learning from data.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been talking a lot about Walker because his book and Ted talk have received a lot of attention.  But the practice of misrepresenting evidence to make a clearer point when teaching . . . that happens all the time.  Tomorrow I&#8217;ll post another example.</p>
<p>I think that the people who do this really don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re doing anything wrong:  they&#8217;re just cleaning up the data to tell a better story.  Just like Marc Hauser did when he insisted on coding all his data himself:  he knew the story and he didn&#8217;t want any random variation to get in the way of it.</p>
<p>The trouble is, once you start mucking with the data, you move from what <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/storytelling.pdf">Thomas Basbøll and I</a> called &#8220;stories&#8221; to what we called &#8220;parables.&#8221;  Data, and good stories, are immutable&#8212;indeed, it&#8217;s this immutability that allow us to learn from data.  When you start trimming your data to fit your preconceptions or to fit the story you want to tell, you&#8217;ve given up your ability to learn.  You&#8217;re no longer doing science&#8212;and you might not be doing good education either.  In the immortal words of John Clute, &#8220;End of novel.  Beginning of job.&#8221;</p>

<p>I agree, and I think this is a good way to put it.</p>
<p>Statistics textbooks sometimes describe statistics as “decision making under uncertainty,” but that always bothered me, because there’s very little about decision making in statistics textbooks.  &#8220;Reasoning&#8221; captures it much more than &#8220;decision making.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>Social science and the replication crisis</p>
<p>The replication crisis is typically discussed in the context of particular silly claims, or in terms of the sociology of science, or with regard to controversies in statistical practice. Here we discuss the content of unreplicated or otherwise shaky empirical claims in social science, which often seem to be associated with a model in which important attitudes and behavior can be easily manipulated using irrelevant stimuli. This set of theories, if true, would have important implications for politics and society, supporting certain views held on the left, right, and technocratic center of the political spectrum.  Conversely, the lack of empirical support for the manipulable-human model has social and political implications which are worth considering:  if people are not so easily swayed in this way, this suggests that we should try to more carefully understand their direct motivations.</p></blockquote>

					<div class="at-above-post-homepage addthis_tool" data-url="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/05/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-scientific-process-according-to-the-people-who-are-in-charge-of-some-social-science-journals/"></div><p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Awhile ago I <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/04/06/important-distinction-truth-evidence/">hypothesized</a> that many researchers &#8220;think they already know the truth, and they think of discussions of evidence, data quality, statistics, etc., as a sort of &#8216;red tape&#8217; or distraction from the larger issues.&#8221;  But now I&#8217;m thinking that it&#8217;s not just statistics but really the entire scientific process that they view as an annoyance.</p>
<p>I think that a lot of social scientists don&#8217;t really care about the process of science, that their attitude is something like 50% careerism and 50% that they feel already know the answers about primatology or criminology or whatever, and they view activities such as faking your data as just the sort of annoying things you need to do to get papers published.</p>
<p>To put it another way:  I suspect that these people see the entire scientific process&#8212;not just statistical analysis but also surveys, experiments, the construction of coherent theories, pretty much the whole megillah&#8212;as a bunch of red tape, just a bunch of hoops they need to jump through so they can move on with their day and get their 8 hours of sleep every night.</p>
<p>Or they might enjoy some activities of the scientific life, such as designing and carrying out experiments, writing papers, going on TV, etc., but they don&#8217;t get the connection between the fun parts and the hard work and inevitable setbacks.</p>
<p>To these people, faking your data is not like robbing a bank.  It&#8217;s like driving 5 miles an hour over the speed limit, or like not filling out some silly form.  Of course they don&#8217;t think people should be &#8220;punished&#8221; for faking data.  Also, they think that correcting or retracting an article or having your public errors pointed out to you is a form of punishment.</p>
<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>We talked <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/03/05/you-dont-want-a-criminal-journal-you-want-a-criminal-journal/">awhile ago</a> about the scandal in criminology of a set of research published published based on misrepresented, falsified, or nonexistent data.</p>
<p>Justin Pickett tells the full story <a href="https://econjwatch.org/File+download/1139/PickettMar2020.pdf">here</a>.  His article is at Econ Journal Watch (&#8220;Scholarly Comments on Academic Economics&#8221;), which I don&#8217;t quite understand, given that these papers are in sociology and criminology journals, not economics journals.  Maybe in a parallel there&#8217;s another journal, Crim Journal Watch (&#8220;Scholarly Comments on Academic Criminologists&#8221;) which published papers about scandals in economics?  But I guess you have to publish things where you can.  It&#8217;s good for Econ Journal Watch that they published this.  From Pickett&#8217;s article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Eric Stewart and his coauthors have retracted five articles from three journals, Social Problems, Criminology, and Law &#038; Society Review. . . . The retraction notices are uninformative, stating only that the authors uncovered an unacceptable number of errors in each article. Misinformation about the event abounds. Some of the authors have continued to insist in print that the retracted findings are correct. . . . The findings suggest that the five articles were likely fraudulent, several coauthors acted with negligence bordering on complicity after learning about the data irregularities, and the editors violated the ethical standards advanced by the Committee on Publication Ethics . . .</p></blockquote>
<p>Beyond our interest in the sordid details here, our horror at what Pickett had to go through in pursuing this case (he was a coauthor of one of the articles in question, and once he started asking questions they refused to share the data with him), and our concern that understanding and policymaking in the important field of criminology is being driven by fake data and fake analysis, there is the question of the general relevance to social science of these extreme cases of scientific misconduct and institutional bad behavior.</p>
<p>There are many levels of bad behavior in science.  Without naming names, I&#8217;ll list some different things we&#8217;ve seen, in roughly declining order of badness of the behavior:</p>
<p>&#8211; Flat out fabrication, people writing about surveys that never existed, reporting data that were never collected, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211; Attacking or otherwise trying to silence critics.</p>
<p>&#8211; Hiding or destroying data so claims can never be checked.</p>
<p>&#8211; Reporting or summarizing data inaccurately and misleadingly.  (This includes, for example, not mentioning key decisions in data exclusion, coding, and analysis.)</p>
<p>&#8211; Dodging criticism, not responding to criticism, changing the subject, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211; Inaccurately and misleadingly reporting implications of data, for example by having the title or abstract make claims about something not addressed in the data, or conversely by not mentioning key conditions or limitations of the conclusions.</p>
<p>&#8211; Misrepresenting or omitting relevant literature. </p>
<p>&#8211; Poor or irrelevant statistical analysis, for example making inappropriate claims from noisy data.</p>
<p>&#8211; Weak statistical analysis, not noticing or reporting notable patterns in the data.</p>
<p>These things can be done by accident or on purpose; for the goal of understanding the research, it doesn&#8217;t really matter which.  Recall <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2009/05/24/handy_statistic/">Clarke&#8217;s Law</a>.  If researchers persist in poor scientific practices, it&#8217;s a problem.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to our question above:  How should we think of these pathological examples of bad behavior such as described in Pickett&#8217;s article?  Is focusing on these cases a mistake, somewhat as if we tried to understand the U.S. criminal justice system by looking at how they handled Jeffrey Dahmer, O. J. Simpson, and Ted Bundy?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure.  One thing I will say, though, is that many of the problems described by Pickett occur, in less extreme form, all the time.  I&#8217;ve seen these problems over and over.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the leadoff to Pickett&#8217;s article:</p>
<blockquote><p>• The retraction notices are vague, providing little information about what went wrong.</p>
<p>• The authors have continued to promote their retracted findings in print, insisting that “the main substantive results are correct” . . .</p>
<p>• Other articles by the authors have some of the same irregularities . . . but thus far only one of these has been corrected and none have been retracted.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, we&#8217;ve seen all these things:</p>
<p>• Retractions are vague, as if the whole thing is some horrible embarrassment rather than the normal practice of open science.</p>
<p>• Refusal to admit specific errors, followed by a refusal to admit the errors have any effect on conclusions.  As I wrote the <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/03/24/why-we-sleep-a-tale-of-institutional-failure/">other day</a>, these people always make a big deal about their data, science science data data experiment experiment statistical significance bla bla&#8212;until the moment the data are revealed to be wrong, and then it turns out the data didn’t matter.  Next time don&#8217;t bother with the experiment and the data and the p-values&#8212;just go straight to the conclusions.  Cut out the damn middleman.</p>
<p>• Offenders are repeat offenders.  We&#8217;re familiar with that pattern.</p>
<p>And then, other things mentioned in Pickett&#8217;s article:</p>
<p>• The attitude that, once something&#8217;s published in a peer-reviewed journal, it&#8217;s assumed to be true unless conclusively demonstrated otherwise.</p>
<p>• Scholars putting personal loyalty above the search for truth.</p>
<p>• Academic bureaucrats and game-players taking a technical dispute (What were the data?  Did the data exist?  How did those numbers get there?) and turning it into something personal.</p>
<p>• Attacks and name-calling against dissenters.</p>
<p>• Repeated attempts to avoid scientific concerns (for example, impossible numbers in a published article) by retreating into procedure.</p>
<p>• Incompetence that is almost charming (for example, not-so-random terminal digits in tabulated numbers).</p>
<p>You might say that none of this matters because this research was never being used for policy.  But maybe it was!  Remember that Brian Wansink received millions of dollars in government and corporate funding and was appointed to a government post. And influential authors and legal scholars have written <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/03/31/stasis-back-in-town-my-last-post-on-cass-sunstein-and-richard-epstein/">gushingly</a> of Wansink&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>I guess the point is that there&#8217;s a lot of this&#8212;indeed, I think there must be a lot that we haven&#8217;t heard about.</p>
<p>Put it this way:  if someone at one of these universities had been caught robbing a bank, would his colleagues have all backed him up like that?  I assume not!  I assume they&#8217;re backing him up because, at some level, they don&#8217;t care about the process of science, that their attitude is something like 50% careerism and 50% that they feel already know the answers about criminology or whatever, and they view activities such as faking your data as just the sort of annoying things you need to do to get papers published.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a general issue, and I think we learned something from considering this example carefully.  This kind of cavalier attitude to what is pretty much the purest sort of scientific fraud makes it clear how little the scientific process is valued, at least in some quarters in academia.  And I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s just Florida State University, given the inclination we&#8217;ve seen of the University of California, Arizona State University, Harvard, Cornell, etc., to look away from clear cases of scholarly misconduct.</p>
<p>It does seem like the general view of many administrators, journal editors, and prominent scientists that the two reasons for the scientific process are (a) to advance people&#8217;s careers, and (b) to confirm people&#8217;s theories.  I&#8217;m guessing that most scientists don&#8217;t think that way, but this silent majority does not have the power and organization and inclination to fight the establishment.</p>
<p>This kind of sounds like a conspiracy theory but I don&#8217;t mean it to be.  My guess is that all the participants in cargo-cult social science&#8212;from the fabricators to the powermongers to the enablers to the just plain incompetents&#8212;sincerely believe they&#8217;re doing good science, in the all-important (to them) sense that they&#8217;re building beautiful careers and confirming beautiful theories.  No conspiracy needed.  They&#8217;re just doing what&#8217;s right, and occasionally they have to waste some of their valuable time swatting away people like Justin Pickett and me and other data thugs, methodological terrorists, and Stasi replication police who insist on some letter-of-the-law paperwork-laden view in which science is about openness, transparency, and data.</p>

					<div class="at-above-post-homepage addthis_tool" data-url="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/04/uri-simonsohns-small-telescopes/"></div><p>I just happened to come across <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797614567341">this paper</a> from 2015 that makes an important point very clearly:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is generally very difficult to prove that something does not exist; it is considerably easier to show that a tool is inadequate for studying that something. With a small-telescopes approach, instead of arriving at the conclusion that a theoretically interesting effect does not seem to exist, we arrive at the conclusion that the original evidence suggesting a theoretically interesting effect exists does not seem to be adequate.</p></blockquote>
<p>This would&#8217;ve been a good thing for us to cite when talking about <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/04/06/important-distinction-truth-evidence/">evidence vs. truth</a>.</p>
<p>To put it another way, a scientific paper typically makes two claims:</p>
<p>1. It&#8217;s likely that X is true.</p>
<p>2. The data provide evidence for X.</p>
<p>It can be difficult to argue point 1, one way or another.  But we should be able to make progress on point 2.  That&#8217;s why I rarely go around saying, &#8220;X doesn&#8217;t work.&#8221;  Rather, I say that I&#8217;ve seen no good evidence for X, and that maybe X works or maybe it doesn&#8217;t, and that I suspect that X has positive effects for some people in some settings and negative effects in other cases.</p>

<blockquote><p>I [Falk] would think it provides a focused opportunity to make a few salient statistical education points.</p>
<p>First, a 6 percent mortality rate (among old people with comorbidities) is really bad, but any single selected person is really quite unlikely to die, or even be really sick.  Same with all the reports about blood clots, six month recovery times, etc., etc.  Even more unlikely.  A prediction: when Trump feels fine in a couple of days this will be taken as one more piece of evidence that this is not a serious disease, which is statistically illiterate on a number of levels.</p>
<p>Second, the reference group (old people with comorbidities) implicitly assumes a standard level of care.  (Changes in the standard of care is one of the main reasons the death rate has fallen so much from the average.) Trump&#8217;s probabilities are way better than that because he gets care that very few other people in the world get.</p>
<p>Third, it will be interesting to see retrospective assessments of the impact of whatever treatments he got.  And of course how poor such retrospective inferences are.</p></blockquote>
<p>That first point reminds me of the <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2011/01/05/for_those_of_yo/">hookah story</a>.</p>

But, according to the National Academy of <a href="https://scatter.wordpress.com/2014/06/03/my-thoughts-on-that-hurricane-study/">Sciences</a>, (google &#8220;himmicanes&#8221; for lots more), it saves lives to give hurricanes the names of boys rather than girls, because people are more scared of boys so they&#8217;ll act with appropriate caution.</p>
<p>Hurricane Butch?  Run away.  Hurricane Missy?  Who cares.</p>
<p>Put the above two ideas together, and . . . let&#8217;s rename Coronavirus to Koronavirus.  That K is scary, huh?  <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/111/24/8782.full.pdf">From</a> the himmicanes paper: &#8220;our model suggests that changing a severe hurricane’s name from Charley (MFI = 2.889, 14.87 deaths) to Eloise (MFI = 8.944, 41.45 deaths) could nearly triple its death toll.&#8221;</p>
<p>41.45 deaths doesn&#8217;t sound like a lot, but those last .45 really hurt.</p>
<p>Apply these ideas to Kovid, and just think what it could do to social distancing behavior.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, should we really be calling it Kovid-19?  Nineteen is kind of a soft, feminine number.  What about Kovid-666?  Or Kovid-17.  Recall that, <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/05/28/29026/">according to Pythagoras</a> (really!), 17 is &#8220;the most despised and horrible of all numbers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmmm, one more thing.  Kovid ends in that soft &#8220;d&#8221; sound.  What about Kovit&#8212;that sounds a bit tougher.</p>
<p>OK, so here&#8217;s my proposal.  No more Covid-19.  Call it Kovit-17.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s just my speculation.  To really figure this out, we need to run an experiment on 42 undergrads and 100 people on Mechanical Turk and find a p-value of less than 0.1.  Even then, I won&#8217;t fully believe it until it&#8217;s been published in Psychological Science or PNAS and been featured on NPR.</p>
<p>No need to wait for the Ted talk, though.  This is serious business, and time is of the essence.</p>
<p>Ok, I did put this one on the six-month lag . . .</p>

<blockquote><p>I thought you might find <a href="https://twitter.com/baumard_nicolas/status/1308715606196342784?s=19">this thread</a> interesting, it&#8217;s about a machine learning paper building a &#8220;trustworthiness score&#8221; from faces databases and historical (mainly British) portraits.</p>
<p>It checks many bias boxes I believe, but my biggest complaint (I know it shouldn&#8217;t be) is the linear regression of basically spherical clouds of points:</p>
<p><img src="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/20200926_004427.jpg" alt="" width="550" /></p></blockquote>
<p>The above-linked thread has disappeared, but <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18566-7">here&#8217;s the paper</a>, which is published in Nature, that famous scientific tabloid.</p>
<p>I replied that this research project looks like lots of fun.  It reminds me of the idea that a student suggested once in class, many years ago, to watch a bunch of movies, and every time you see someone with a gun, see if he or she is on the left or the right side of the frame.  Gather a bunch of data, and who knows what you might find?  I&#8217;m a big fan of this sort of open-ended project.</p>
<p>I do have a problem with the researchers&#8217; conclusions, though.  First off, they keeps talking about &#8220;trustworthiness&#8221; or &#8220;computed trustworthiness&#8221; when they really mean &#8220;a measure that is weakly correlated with respondents&#8217; judgments about trustworthiness.&#8221;  Second, they makes the unsupported claim that &#8220;Quantifying trustworthiness tells us how much looking nice and trustworthy is important in a society.&#8221;  Third, they do cross-national comparisons, but where are the human trustworthiness judgments coming from.  Fourth, they do changes over time without recognizing the problem that their calibrations are all taking place now:  even setting aside all other problems here, there&#8217;s no reason to think that trustworthiness as judged in a painting 500 years ago would be anything like how it is judged now.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d summarize that the big problem here is the confusion of the measure (some geometrical characteristics of a painted face) with an underlying construct of interest (trustworthiness).  This is a huge problem.  One way to think about it is that you could take a particular person and paint him or her in 100 different ways and get widely varying &#8220;computed trustworthiness&#8221; scores.  But it would be the same person every time!  It&#8217;s not like he or she would be varying in actual trustworthiness.  So I see a big conceptual problem here.</p>
<p>In short, it could be a fun project without the overclaiming.  But without the overclaiming I guess we wouldn&#8217;t&#8217;ve heard about this project at all.  We&#8217;ve discussed this paradox before.</p>
<p>I also cc-ed Dan Simpson who added:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s nice to see digital phrenology branching out from criminality and finding the gays, I guess. </p>
<p>Also it’s hard to really take the data set seriously. Is there any reason to think that a portrait is in the national gallery because it’s photorealistic? It would not be that hard to imagine a portrait artist making their subject look more dominant or weaker or more trustworthy or less by the specific standards of the day and place (again, that’s a very slippery standard). </p>
<p>Also styles of portraiture and the facial expressions that are considered neutral or artistic change massively over this time period. There’s a lot of “lesbians wear more baseball caps” going on: people scowl a lot in old portraits. </p>
<p>There’s probably something about the way the structure of the economy changed and what that means both for who has a famous portrait and how the gdp relates to an individual. But that would require going deeper into the structural assumptions than this paper probably deserves. </p>
<p>Related (different nature journal): did you know that the presence of mountains <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-020-0930-x">explains</a> your openness to new experiences? I feel very bad for the people of The Netherlands and Denmark.</p></blockquote>
<p>I replied that actually this is worse than phrenology.  Phrenology at least corresponds to stable characteristics of individuals.  But this coding is all about facial expressions.  As a person with Tourette&#8217;s who&#8217;s never been able to look people in the eye (which according to my elementary school teachers was necessary for any trustworthy person), I find it particularly annoying.</p>
<p>Let me emphasize what I wrote above, that I think this could be a fine research project if conducted in an exploratory spirit and not over-sold.  When I say it&#8217;s &#8220;worse than phrenology,&#8221; I&#8217;m speaking of the science; I&#8217;m not making any moral or societal claims.</p>
<p>From a statistical point of view, the big problem here is not taking measurement seriously. Remember, measurement is <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2015/04/28/whats-important-thing-statistics-thats-not-textbooks/">the most important thing in statistics that’s not in the textbooks</a>.  Remember that example from a few years ago, that study that <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2017/01/03/about-that-claim-that-north-korea-had-moderate-electoral-integrity/">claimed</a> that North Carolina was less democratic than North Korea?  Measurement, baby, measurement.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong>  It&#8217;s pretty funny that most of the comments on this post are about the name of the journal, Nature Communications, and almost nothing on the actual paper under discussion.  The paper fails as clickbait if nobody even wants to argue about it!</p>

<p>We have written a lot about both our presidential election model at the Economist and Fivethirtyeight&#8217;s since they both launched in the summer. We even wrote a <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/jdm200907b.pdf">journal article</a> (with Jessica Hullman and Chris Wlezien) about what we can learn from them about Bayseian model testing and the various incentives toward (or against) expressing uncertainty. But it&#8217;s fair to say we&#8217;ve done a bit more criticizing of 538&#8217;s method than our own. Of course, we think ours is &#8220;better&#8221; (though there&#8217;s no way of knowing for sure&#8212;we can&#8217;t actually run the election 40,000 times) so this makes sense, but there are some things in our model that we&#8217;ve been reconsidering over time. </p>
<p>Recall that <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/08/31/problem-of-the-between-state-correlations-in-the-fivethirtyeight-election-forecast/">we think</a> some of the probabilities in 538&#8217;s model are implausibly large given both polls so far and the political fundamentals. Some of their simulations have Joe Biden winning by 10 percentage points in Alabama or 25 in Florida, which seem to us to be impossible outcomes today. Still it is hard to gauge the likelihood of these events given the design of their primary state-level graphics (they pick 100 simulations out of 40,000 to represent individual odds, which may exaggerate the perceived probability of tail events) or even to interpret probabilities as low as 1 or 2 in 40,000.</p>
<p>We also think there&#8217;s a reason for these fat tails. The 538 model also appears to have between-state correlations that are too low, once you add all its errors; right now it seems to be giving Joe Biden a 50% chance of winning in the electoral college conditional on him losing California, despite the fact that it&#8217;s the fourth most Democratic state in the country. But such low between-state correlations necessitates higher state-level errors to arrive at a given target uncertainty for national error.</p>
<p>On the flip side of this is our Economist model, which has high state-level correlations and comparatively skinny tails. This introduces some downstream effects worth taking a second look at. </p>
<p>Various readers have suggested that our high correlations and normally-distributed tails might be leading to some implausible conditional probabilities. For example, commenter Adam <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/09/28/information-incentives-and-goals-in-election-forecasts-2/#comment-1500643">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Your latest simulation contains 13,789 outcomes where Biden wins Ohio. In <em>all</em> cases where Biden wins Ohio, he also wins the electoral college. This is pretty astonishing, I would think. Is it really true that given Biden winning Ohio, Trump has basically no chance (<0.01%) of winning Pennsylvania and Wisconsin? (This never happened in 40,000 simulations.)</p></blockquote>
<p>We weren&#8217;t sure what to think about this particular conditional probability, so we decided to get some context by looking at our simulations for all 50 states.</p>
<p>The chart below plots Biden&#8217;s average share of the national popular vote in simulations where he loses, ties or wins in each state:</p>
<p><a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/natpop-scaled.jpeg"><img src="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/natpop-scaled.jpeg" alt="" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>We counted simulations as ties when each candidate got between 49% and 51% of the two-party vote&#8212;we had to give this interval some width so as to get enough simulations to be able to compute conditional distributions (here summarized by median, 50% interval, and 95% interval) in each case.</p>
<p>The above graph includes all cases with at least 1% probability in our simulations.  For example, in the states at the top of the above graph, Biden is close to a lock&#8212;there&#8217;s less than a 1% chance of Biden winning less than 49% of the vote, or winning between 49% and 51% of the vote&#8212;so we only display the distribution of his national vote share conditional on Biden winning more than 51% of the vote.  For the states in the middle of the graph&#8212;from Colorado to Missouri&#8212;all three possibilities are live options.  And the states on the bottom are almost certainly going for Trump.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at Ohio.  In the simulations where Biden wins more than 50% of the vote in Ohio, we estimate he would be winning close to 56% (95% interval [53%, 58%]) of the national two-party vote.  If Biden pulls off a tie in Ohio, we estimate he&#8217;d win 54% [52%, 56%] of the national vote.  And if Biden loses Ohio, we still expect he&#8217;d win the popular vote, but there&#8217;s a small chance he could lose the election (as can be seen from the 95% interval overlapping 50%).</p>
<p>What about the Electoral College?  We made the same plots, this time showing the forecast median, 50%, and 95% intervals for Biden&#8217;s electoral vote total, conditioning on each of the state outcomes:</p>
<p><a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ec-scaled.jpeg"><img src="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ec-scaled.jpeg" alt="" width="600" /></a></p>
<p>And, indeed, if Biden ties in Ohio, our forecast gives him over a 97.5% chance of prevailing in the electoral college.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s popular vote and electoral college averages for the conditional Ohio win make sense to us. Given how red the state is relative to the nation as a whole, Biden would have to be doing very well nationally to win the majority of Ohio voters. But the uncertainty in our predictions has raised a flag. </p>
<p>Are we really sure that Trump would win 0 out of 40,000 elections in which he loses Ohio? On the one hand, it&#8217;s hard to even imagine what 40,000 elections means. Our model is saying that an upset Trump popular vote victory if he&#8217;s losing Ohio would require a never-before-seen combination of polling error and vote swing in one direction for Ohio while a large swing in the opposite direction is happening in the rest of the country. And given the high correlations between states (in fact, in our model, Ohio has the highest average correlation with all other states, which is reflected in its relatively narrow prediction intervals for Ohio in the above graphs) it makes sense to assign a relatively low probability to this outcome. But is 0 out of 40,000 too low?</p>
<p>Given the potential problem here, it might make sense for us to use a fat-tailed distribution in our model. Not quite as fat as Fivethirtyeight&#8217;s (which gives Biden an approximate 3% chance of winning Alabama and Trump a 1% chance of winning <del datetime="2020-10-02T01:06:18+00:00">California</del> Hawaii [see <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/10/01/how-to-think-about-extremely-unlikely-events-such-as-biden-winning-alabama-trump-winning-california-or-biden-winning-ohio-but-losing-the-election/#comment-1503972">here</a>), but a compromise between the two. At one point, we were using a t distribution with 7 degrees of freedom, but we scrapped it because it didn&#8217;t address other issues we were concerned with at the time. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re open to feedback here. On the one hand, we can talk ourselves into believing the graphs above. On the other, a forecast probability of less than 0.000025 chance does seem too low. (Or does it?)</p>
<p>To push this further, what&#8217;s the chance of Trump winning California?  As of two years ago, say, either such event was highly unlikely, but maybe we shouldn&#8217;t say impossible&#8212;after all, Reagan won 49 states in 1984.  But right now, a month before the election with the incumbent president down by 8 points in the polls, with an approval rating in the 40% range, and a dismal economy . . . it&#8217;s hard to imagine.  (Remember, our model is predicting vote intention, and it&#8217;s conditional on all the votes being counted and neither candidate dying, becoming incapacitated, or being removed from the ballot before election day.)  For that matter, it&#8217;s hard at this point to picture Biden winning Wyoming.  Are the probabilities of either of these events less than 1 in 40,000?  What about the probability of Trump winning D.C.?  Do we call that 1 in a million?</p>
<p>The probabilities of such super-unlikely events seem to us to be essentially unquantifiable with any precision.</p>
<p>A few years ago, we wrote an article, <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/decisive2.pdf">Estimating the probability of events that have never occurred: When is your vote decisive?</a>, where we promoted the idea of estimating the probability of rare events by extrapolating from less rare &#8220;precursor events.&#8221;  </p>
<p>For example, what&#8217;s the probability that a single vote would be decisive in a large election?  It&#8217;s hard to get any direct empirical estimate of the probability of a tied election, but we <em>can</em> empirically estimate the probability that the election is within 10,000 votes, and then divide that probability by 10,000.  (See the appendix on the very last page of <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/gelmankatzbafumi.pdf">this article</a> for an explanation of why such calculations make sense even in the presence of possible recounts.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can&#8217;t see how one could define precursors for events such as &#8220;Trump wins California,&#8221; &#8220;Biden wins Wyoming,&#8221; or &#8220;Biden loses the national election conditional on winning Ohio.&#8221;  We can get a somewhat reasonable estimate of the probability that Trump gets at least 35% of the vote in California (we currently forecast him at 33% in that state), but any model taking him from there to 50% seems completely speculative.</p>
<p>Regarding Trump winning California or Biden winning Wyoming:  we could just say:  Hey, anything could happen, and we don&#8217;t want the probability to be less than 1 in 40,000&#8212;but that just pushes the decision back one step.  Should we then say that Trump has a 1 in 10,000 chance of winning the state?  1 in 1000?  1 in 100?  1 in 50?  Any of these choices has an element of arbitrariness.  You could say that 1 in 100 or 1 in 50 is a more conservative choice; on the other hand, assigning too-high probabilities to uncertain events could create problems if this encourages people to overreact to extremely unlikely possibilities. Both the creation and evaluation of such predictions are strongly model-based, and ultimately we have to think of these not as pure forecasting problems but as questions of political science:  how wrong do we think the polls can be, and how large do we think swings could be in the month before the election?</p>
<p>If you do want to change our forecast and allow fat-tailed errors&#8212;which you can do, as all our code&#8217;s <a href="https://projects.economist.com/us-2020-forecast/president">on Github!</a>&#8212;we recommend you include these fat-tailed errors as a national error term, not as independent state errors.  If Biden really does with Alabama or Trump wins California, this would arise from some combination of unprecedented polling errors and unprecedented last-month swings&#8212;and, in this case, it&#8217;s hard to imagine this happening in just one state.</p>

<p><iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" style="position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);" title="&#8220;Vitamin D Can Likely End the COVID-19 Pandemic&#8221; &#8212; Rootclaim Blog" src="https://blog.rootclaim.com/vitamin-d-can-likely-end-the-covid-19-pandemic/embed/#?secret=DFaZJ83M9I" data-secret="DFaZJ83M9I" width="500" height="282" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p>
<p>What is striking is the analysis by the Rootclaim group – repeated reliance on p values as the be all and end all of analysis.  They even have the statement “It is important to understand that once a p-value has been obtained, the sample size no longer matters.”  I only wish the raw data was available, because I am unable to do my own analysis.  The randomization was far from perfect – there are numerous substantial differences between the two groups.  They do note this, but their defense is that they performed a logistic regression, including (some of) those different factors, and the p values indicate that the results are robust.  But which additional factors?  Hard to tell.  And, once again, the data are not available (as far as I can tell).  The Rootclaim analysis does include a sort of “decision analysis” of whether or not to use vitamin D, which is a good thing.  But it seems to state far too much certainty in the estimates for my taste.</p>
<p>Also, it appears that they did a Bayesian analysis (I hadn’t read that far yet), so you might want to look at that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s their key finding:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of 50 patients treated with calcifediol, one required admission to the ICU (2%), while of 26 untreated patients, 13 required admission (50%).</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, if this difference is real (and not explained by pretreatment differences between the groups, or by admission-to-the-ICU decisions that were not based on medical conditions) then this is a huge effect, and statistical significance wouldn&#8217;t come into play.  A graph of outcome vs. pre-treatment risk factors would help here, especially if you could get some sort of continuous outcome, not just ICU-or-not.  would be useful here. The p-value is kind of irrelevant, but there&#8217;s no harm in calculating it either.</p>
<p>The thing that confuses me is that the title of the published paper says this is &#8220;a pilot randomized clinical study.&#8221;  The <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2018/03/20/purpose-pilot-study-demonstrate-feasibility-experiment-not-estimate-treatment-effect/">purpose</a> of a pilot study is to demonstrate the feasibility of an experiment, not to estimate the treatment effect.  In this case, they had a controlled experiment, so why do they call it &#8220;a pilot randomized clinical study&#8221; and not just &#8220;a randomized clinical study&#8221;?  Apparently the assignment was not double-blind, but then I&#8217;d think you&#8217;d call it &#8220;an unblinded randomized clinical study.&#8221; I don&#8217;t get why they called it a pilot.</p>
<p>I certainly <em>don&#8217;t</em> want to suggest that the results of an experiment should be discarded just because it was unblinded (or, for that matter, unrandomized, were that the case).  Perfect studies are rate, and generally we just need to consider possible flaws, adjust as well as we can, replicate replicate replicate, and then study variation in the treatment effect.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, I&#8217;m talking about multilevel modeling again.  You don&#8217;t think this treatment has the same effect on all people, right?  It will help some people more than others, might even hurt some people.  And given that the effect varies across people, it will vary across groups as well, so you&#8217;ll expect to see different effects in different experimental settings.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t directly affect the analysis of the study described above, but it gives us a sense of what might come next.</p>

<blockquote><p>What is your instinct on the following.  Consider at each time t, 1999 through 2019, there is a probability P_t for some event (e.g., it rains on a given day that year).  Assume that P_t = P_1999 + (t-1999)A.  So P_t has a linear time trend.  What we wish to understand is whether P_t is growing or shrinking over time and by how much. </p>
<p>Gathering data is manual and costly.    Is it better to gather 100 observations from 1999 and 100 from 2019.  Or is it better to gather 10 observations per year for 20 years.  My instincts are to gather 100 from 1999 and 100 from 2019 — that this will have more power.</p></blockquote>
<p>My reply:</p>
<p>Yes, this is a standard problem in experimental design, and to first approximation it is best to gather data from the extremes, ie. your intuition is correct.  You can see this through the formula for the standard error of the regression coefficient (it&#8217;s all in closed form when you&#8217;re just estimating linear regression with one predictor).  There is one complication, though, in that you have discrete data so if the probabilities are close to 0 or 1 you&#8217;ll need more data to compensate for the additional variation.</p>
<p>Simplest way to figure out the optimal solution (and also to make it understandable) is to do a simulation.</p>
<p>Also perhaps relevant is <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/27.pdf">this article</a> I wrote a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong>  As with <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2005/10/06/god_is_in_every/">all problems</a>, this all gets more and more interesting the more you look into it.  In practice, yes, you can best estimate the slope from points at the edge of the range, but that seems wrong, somehow.  But, as discussed in my linked article, even if you gather data from the middle of the curve, it can be hard to pick up on nonlinearity.  So much depends on the ultimate goals of your data collection and analysis.</p>
<p><strong>P.P.S.</strong>  I looked through the comments, and . . . please read the article I linked to above, <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/27.pdf">Should we take measurements at an intermediate design point?</a>  It directly addresses many of the things you&#8217;re talking about! !!</p>

<blockquote><p>Presidential elections can be forecast using information from political and economic conditions, polls, and a statistical model of changes in public opinion over time. However, these “knowns” about how to make a good presidential election forecast come with many unknowns due to the challenges of evaluating forecast calibration and communication. We highlight how incentives may shape forecasts, and particularly forecast uncertainty, in light of calibration challenges. We illustrate these challenges in creating, communicating, and evaluating election predictions, using the Economist and Fivethirtyeight forecasts of the 2020 election as examples, and other recommendations for forecasters and scholars.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are the contents of the article:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 What we know about forecasting presidential elections</p>
<p>1.1 Political and economic fundamentals</p>
<p>1.2 Pre-election surveys and poll aggregation</p>
<p>1.3 State and national predictions</p>

<p>4 Discussion</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s published in the journal Judgment and Decision Making; <a href="http://journal.sjdm.org/vol15.5.html">here&#8217;s the whole issue</a>.</p>
<p>The most political sciencey part of the article is section 1, where we discuss the data and background knowledge that go into a national election forecast, and how we put that information together.</p>
<p>From a psychology point of view, the most interesting aspect of the article is section 3, where we talk about incentives for over- and under-confidence.  This is relevant to our <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/08/31/more-on-that-fivethirtyeight-prediction-that-biden-might-only-get-42-of-the-vote-in-florida/">discussion</a> from a few months ago on some of the outlandish predictions of the Fivethirtyeight election forecast.</p>
<p>And the part that is most interesting from the perspective of statistical workflow is section 2, especially section 2.4 on graphical communication of uncertainty and section 2.3 where we argue that the ability of forecasts to make implausible predictions (again, see the above link for a couple of examples) is a feature, not a bug, in that it gives forecasters a chance to find flaws and go back and fix their methods.</p>
<p>We posted an earlier version of our article <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/09/08/information-incentives-and-goals-in-election-forecasts/">a few weeks ago</a>; this is a new and improved version.</p>

<blockquote><p>This morning I stumbled across a very interesting <a href="https://hillelwayne.com/post/this-is-how-science-happens/">blog post</a>, dissecting some drama related to a non-replicating paper in computer science land. The question the paper tries to answer is whether some programming languages are more error prone than others. For a paper in computer science I would expect all their data and code to be open to begin with, but it wasn&#8217;t! As it turns out, once people got their hands on the data and code, they found severe flaws and wrote a rebuttal paper. And then there was a rebuttal rebuttal, etc. </p>
<p>I think this story is worth sharing for the following reasons:</p>
<p>&#8211; It&#8217;s a very recognizable example outside of social sciences.</p>
<p>&#8211; There is some indication the conclusions might be true even if the methodology to reach them was totally flawed.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting.  One thing, though.  The linked post, by Hillel Wayne, starts off:</p>
<blockquote><p>I love science. Not the “space is beautiful” faux-science, but the process of doing science. Hours spent calibrating equipment, cross-checking cites of cites of cites, tedious arguments about p-values and prediction intervals, all the stuff that makes science Go.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Tedious arguments about p-values . . .&#8221;:  sure, that <em>can</em> be part of the process of doing science, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be!  There&#8217;s a whole world of serious science where the statistics goes straight to the scientific questions, and you don&#8217;t have to argue about p-values at all.  Just for example see <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/Kharouba_etal_2018.pdf">here</a> or <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/bjps1993.pdf">here</a> or a zillion other applied papers <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/">here</a>.  I&#8217;m not saying you can&#8217;t do good science using p-values, nor am I saying that arguing about p-values can&#8217;t be a part of good science, nor am I trying to argue with Wayne&#8217;s personal experience doing science&#8212;I&#8217;m just saying it doesn&#8217;t have to be that way.  As Don Rubin liked to say, one aspect of a good statistical method is that it allows you to spend less time talking about the statistics and more time talking about the science.</p>
<p>That linked post features this definition: &#8220;The P-value is the probability that you would have seen the same result if the hypothesis wasn’t true, purely due to other factors.&#8221;  This is wrong.  That&#8217;s fine.  The author of the post is not a statistician. If I tried to describe some computer science term in my own words, without cheating and looking it up first, I&#8217;d probably get it wrong too.  But I think this does add support to my idea that scientists and engineers have better things to do than argue about p-values.  Sometimes it seems that the only thing more common than a practitioner misunderstanding a p-value is someone misunderstanding p-values in the process of trying to explain them to others!  Later he describes the p-value as &#8220;the probability that a &#8216;coincidence&#8217; could explain the data.&#8221;  That&#8217;s wrong.  It&#8217;s true that the p-value is a probability, and it does have something to do with coincidences, and it also has something to do with data, but that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>Also, Wayne writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Don’t trust anything that’s not replicated.</p>
<p>If an effect exists, it should be observable by anyone in similar conditions. This is one of the core foundations of empirical science: all claims should be replicated by a third party. If something doesn’t replicate, then the effect is more limited than we expected, or there was an implicit assumption in the original experiment, or somebody made a mistake somewhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometimes.  Not always.  There are observational sciences such as political science and economics, where you can&#8217;t just run 10 more elections or start 10 more civil wars in order to get new data.  I mean, sure, maybe the appropriate response to this is to not trust economics or political science, and maybe that&#8217;s right&#8212;but that just pushes things back one step, and we have to decide how to make decisions and understand the world given science that can&#8217;t be trusted.</p>
<p>And one other thing.  Near the end of the post is the following advice:</p>
<blockquote><p>Be diligent with your threats to validity. Check all of your assumptions. Don’t blindly trust automation. Don’t dox other scientists. The usual.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with most of this.  But what&#8217;s with &#8220;Don&#8217;t dox other scientists&#8221;?  First off, if doxing is a bad idea, we shouldn&#8217;t dox anyone, right?  But was there any doxing involved?  I scrolled through the post and found that someone linked to someone else&#8217;s Facebook account.  I&#8217;m not on Facebook so I&#8217;m not at all sure about this, but isn&#8217;t a Facebook account public?  I&#8217;m confused about how it is doxing to link to that.  I do agree that it&#8217;s better to keep science discussions scientific rather than personal; I just feel like I&#8217;ve lost the thread somewhere along the line regarding the doxing.</p>
<p>But let me conclude with a point that really resonates with me.</p>
<p>Wayne writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is this even a good idea?</p>
<p>We’ve just spent several thousand words on methodology to show how the original FSE paper was flawed. But was that all really necessary? Most people point to a much bigger issue: the entire idea of measuring a language’s defect rate via GitHub commits just doesn’t make any sense. How the heck do you go from “these people have more DFCs” to “this language is more buggy”? I saw this complaint raised a lot, and if we just stop there I could have skipped rereading all the papers a dozen times over.</p>
<p>Jan Vitek emphasizes this in his talk: if they just said “the premise is nonsense”, nobody would have listened to them. It’s only by showing that the FSE authors messed up methodologically that TOPLAS could establish “sufficient cred” to attack the premise itself. The FSE authors put in a lot of effort into their paper. Responding to that all is “nuh-uh your premise is nonsense” is bad form, even if the premise is nonsense. Who is more trustworthy: the people who spent years getting their paper through peer review, or a random internet commenter who probably stopped at the abstract?</p>
<p>It all comes back to science as a social enterprise. We use markers of trust and integrity as heuristics on whether or not to devote time to understanding the claim itself. This is the same reason people are more likely to listen to a claim coming from a respected scientist than from a crackpot. Pointing out a potential threat to validity isn’t nearly as powerful as showing how that threat actually undermines the paper, and that’s what TOPLAS had to do to be taken seriously.</p></blockquote>
<p>Setting aside all the technical details here, which I&#8217;m not in any position to evaluate, I think Wayne is on to something here, and it reminds me of the asymmetries between publishing new ideas and publishing criticisms, which we&#8217;ve discussed <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2020/09/03/battle-of-the-open-science-asymmetries/">here</a>, <a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/06/17/the-publication-asymmetry-what-happens-if-the-new-england-journal-of-medicine-publishes-something-that-you-think-is-wrong/">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/ChanceEthics8.pdf">here</a>, among other places.  That last article has the title, &#8220;It&#8217;s too hard to publish criticisms and obtain data for replication,&#8221; which pretty much says it all.</p>
<p><a href="https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2019/06/25/another-regression-discontinuity-disaster-and-what-can-we-learn-from-it/">It&#8217;s indeed frustrating</a> to see bad work, work that&#8217;s clearly bad, and to feel that the only way to criticize it is to first put in a ton of effort to figure out exactly what went wrong.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like if someone was trying to sell you a perpetual motion machine and the only way you could get him off your doorstep is to figure out exactly where&#8217;s the connection to the hidden power supply, and then once you did that, other people jumped out of the bushes to say that it&#8217;s a really good perpetual motion machine and the people who created it are promising scholars and why are you being so picky what is it you don&#8217;t want to save the world with free power etc etc.  Enough to make you want to drift into stream of consciousness, at the very least.</p>
<p><strong>P.S.</strong>  The post concludes with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>I shared a first draft of this essay on my newsletter, all the way back in November. It’s pretty much the same content as my blog except weekly instead of monthly. So if you like my writing, why not subscribe?</p></blockquote>
<p>That makes me think that I could charge people money to read my blog posts 6 months ahead of time . . .</p>
